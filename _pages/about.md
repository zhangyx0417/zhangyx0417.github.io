Hi! I'm Yanxi Zhang (张雁熙). My english name is Michael, which I have been using it for over ten years! I am a final-year M.S. student at [Web Information Processing Lab, Wangxuan Institute for Computer Technology, Peking University](http://wip.wict.pku.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Dongyan Zhao](https://www.wict.pku.edu.cn/zhaodongyan/en/). I am also a research intern at [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/), advised by [Dr. Chaochao Lu](https://causallu.com/). I received the B.Eng. degree from [School of Big Data and Software Engineering, Chongqing University](http://www.cse.cqu.edu.cn/) in 2023.

I am currently focusing on **causal reasoning in large models**, especially in enhancing and evaluating their causal reasoning capabilities. I am also interested in information extraction, e.g., understanding the relationships between events in documents.
